# NYC-High-Schools

In this project, I explored relationships between SAT Scores and NYC Demographic Factors in New York City Public High Schools. I used Pandas to read in the various datasets, cleaned them and then combined the datasets into one file for easy analysis. Then I created a few scatter plots to easily visualize the relationships between SAT Scores and various Demographic Factors.

Below is a dashboard that I created using Tableau visualizing the different relationships as well as a sample of some of my code. The full Jupyter Notebook is linked in the repository.
