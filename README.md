# NYC-High-Schools

In this project, I explored relationships between SAT Scores and NYC Demographic Factors in New York City Public High Schools. I used Pandas to read in the various datasets, cleaned them and then combined the datasets into one file for easy analysis. Then I created a few scatter plots to easily visualize the relationships between SAT Scores and various Demographic Factors.

Below is a dashboard that I created using Tableau from the combined dataset that visualizes the different relationships.

My results reveal that the SAT is unfair for recent Immigrants and schools were most of the students are not native English speakers.
